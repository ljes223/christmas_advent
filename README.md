An HTML/CSS Christmas advent calendar!

I created this for my partner as a Christmas gift, but put the bare bones of it on here (the messages and music sections have been replaced with filler)! This advent calendar spans 25 days, with a box representing each one. Each box is a button that, when clicked on, opens a popup containing a new daily message and plays a new daily song. These two are contingent on a check to see if it is the correct day (you can't open day 15 before day 15, for example).

Here is what it looks like when you first open the page:

Here is an example of the basic popup:
